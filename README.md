## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, Authentication, Real-time subscriptions)

### Database Schema
\`\`\`
users (Supabase Auth)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ books (user's book collection)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ offers (trade requests)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exchanges (completed trades)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ messages (future chat functionality)
\`\`\`

### Key Design Patterns

#### 1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
All database operations are secured with Supabase RLS policies ensuring users can only access their own data and publicly available information.

#### 2. **Component Composition**
Modular component architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- UI components (`components/ui/`)
- Feature components (`components/vault/`, `components/offers/`)
- Page components (`app/`)

## üìà Scalability Considerations

### Current Architecture Benefits
1. **Serverless Backend**: Supabase handles scaling automatically
2. **Edge Deployment**: Vercel provides global CDN and edge functions

### Scaling Strategies

#### For 10K+ Users
- **Database Indexing**: Add indexes on frequently queried columns (genre, location, created_at)
- **Caching**: Implement Redis for frequently accessed data (popular books, user sessions)
- **Image Storage**: Move to dedicated CDN (Cloudinary, AWS S3)

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. **Privacy First**
- Contact information is only revealed after mutual agreement
- Users control their book visibility (public/private)
- No personal data is shared without explicit consent

### 2. **Trust & Safety**
- User verification through email authentication

### 3. **User Experience**
- Intuitive navigation and clear user flows
- Minimal friction in the trading process

### 4. **Community Building**
- Local focus encourages face-to-face exchanges
- Book condition transparency builds trust
- Simple rating system (future enhancement)

### 5. **Sustainability**
- Promotes book reuse and circular economy
- Reduces waste by extending book lifecycles
- Encourages reading culture and knowledge sharing
